# DSA-Questions

This repository has challenging questions done to hone my skill in data structures and algorithms.

It includes:
Binary search tree problems
1. Find the 'k'th smallest and largest element of a BST
2. Find the lowest common ancestor of a given BST, given two elements in it
3. Find optimal cost of a BST
4. Given a Balanced Binary Search Tree and a target sum, find a pair which sums up to that target sum
5. Inorder, reverse inorder, preorder and postorder traversals of a BST tree
6. Convert a random tree into a BST
7. Check if the BSTs are equal 

Dynamic programming problems
1. Find minimum number of coins/notes (in rupees) to make a given value (Coin Change)
2. Given a value and three segments of length allowed to be inputted, maximize the total number of cut segments
3. Given that a person can move 1,2 or 3 steps at a time, find the different number of ways they can move distance 'n'.
4. Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations to convert one string to another
5. Egg dropping puzzle
6. Optimal strategy for a game
7. Given two strings, find the length longest common substring present in both strings
8. Given an array, find the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence
9. Given a distinct 2D matrix, find the maximum length path from a cell to go to another cell (but each step of the path must increase)
10. Find least cost path in a matrix from initial to a final position
11. Given a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

Graph problems
1. Check if given graph is bipartite or not
2. Given a chess board, find the minimum number of steps taken by a Knight to reach given destination from given source
3. Find if a given graph has a cycle.
4. Kahn's topological sort algorithm
5. In a directed graph, find the total number of routes to reach the 	destination from given source that have exactly 'm' edges.
6. Snake and ladder shortest number of steps.
7. Find if a graph is strongly connected or not.
8. Check if an undirected connected graph is 2-edge connected or not
9. Topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
10. Transitive closure, form connectivit matrix of a graph
